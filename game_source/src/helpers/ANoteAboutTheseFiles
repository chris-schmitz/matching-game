Both BrowserStorage and LocalStorage are seeking to do the same thing: save data in local browser storage

I wrote the browserStorage class first when I was only concerned with saving game states.
Now that we know we need to save multiple types of data into local storage it would be worth merging these two classes or at least
abstracting the common parts and extending classes for game state and card storage.

regardless, it's not something I'm going to do right now ;P
