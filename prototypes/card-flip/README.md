# Card Flip

> A prototype for the card flipping action and general gameplay of the matching game.

![demo]()

This prototype is me working out exactly how the matching game gameplay will work and feel. It's also one of my first real dives into vuex outside of tutorials.

Some general plans and the gameplay workflow for this prototype can be found in this [draw.io diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxhfk2Nciu7jOXM4ZDBUZ2M2cUk/view?usp=sharing) (you'll need google drive to view this document).

The gameplay follows this workflow found in the draw.io diagram and the logic can be found in the `src/Store.js` file:

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
